This is a checklist to go through before making a new release:

When code has changed:
    1. Update documentation
    2. Write new version in __init__.py
    3. Change/add examples
    4. Write some tests
    5. Run a documentation test build in readthedocs using dev-branch
    6. Make commit and pull request from dev to master
    7. Accept pr in master
    8. Build from master using $ hatch build, pay attention to version number
    9. Upload using $ twine upload dist/*

When documentation, examples and/or tests have changed:
    1. Make PR from dev into master
    2. Run a build in readthedocs in the dev-branch
    3. Make a pull request from dev into master
